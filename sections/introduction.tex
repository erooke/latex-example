\section{Introduction}
This is a simple toy document to show off a \texttt{SCons} based \LaTeX{} workflow.
\texttt{SCons} will manage all the finicky latex stuff by some magic that I don't
understand. The included \texttt{Makefile} then includes a couple useful commands:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
   \texttt{make} simply builds the document
  \item
    \texttt{make watch} watch for any changes, rebuild the document on those changes
  \item
    \texttt{make clean} remove any build artifacts (including the document itself)
\end{itemize}
