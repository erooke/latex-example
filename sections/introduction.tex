\section{Introduction}
This is a simple toy document to show off a \texttt{SCons} based \LaTeX{} workflow.
\texttt{SCons} will manage all the finicky latex stuff by some magic that I don't
understand. The included \texttt{Makefile} then includes a couple useful commands:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
   \texttt{make} simply builds the document
  \item
    \texttt{make watch} watch for any changes, rebuild the document on those changes
  \item
    \texttt{make check} spell checks the document
  \item
    \texttt{make clean} remove any build artifacts (including the document itself)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spell checking}

There are two files which help define spell checking behavior. First is the
personal world list \texttt{.aspell.en.pws} which contains any words which you
would like to be treated as correct. When you select add in Aspell this is the
document it adds the word to. The other is the personal replacement list
\texttt{.aspell.en.prepl} which contains a list of words which you want to be
automatically replaced. The syntax of this file is \texttt{misspelled\_word
correction}. To the best of my knowledge there is no way to add to this list
from Aspell itself. Also it isn't working at the moment. I'm not 100\% sure why.
